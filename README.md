# ICS2O0-Projects
Projects I worked on in Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies. 
Here, you will find the 2 main projects I worked on during my Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies course. They were made in Python.
The first one is a Blackjack game, and the second one is a Pokemon Battle simulator.
